# OpenALPR
Automatic Number Plate Recognition related scripts for OpenALPR


install_OpenALPR_on_Pi.sh

This will install a working copy of OpenALPR with all its dependancies. It takes a long time for this to build all the source code.
I have built this on a the "2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite" image and all wored fine.
This uses the newest version of the dependancies I could get to comile together.
leptonica-1.75.3, Tesseract3.05.00 and OpenCV3.4.0
